# Vector Clocks

This is a verification of the [Vector Clock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_clock) algorithm using [PlusCal](https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/pluscal.html).

> PlusCal (formerly called +CAL) is an algorithm language based on TLA+.  A PlusCal algorithm is translated to a TLA+ specification, which can be checked with the TLC model checker.

TLA+ is a specification language that allows aoeus checking of the correctness of an abstract algorithm.
