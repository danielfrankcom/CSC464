# Assignment 1

Each of the folders represent a different concurrency problem, each of which has 2 implementations. A `readme.md` file helps to explain what each of the problems is, and some information about the implementations themselves.

The numbers contained in the readme correspond to the following requirements:

1. Write a short paragraph outlining how this problem shows up in software today.
2. Implement two possible solutions, and compare/contrast them in terms (1) correctness, (2) comprehensibility, and (3) performance. If you do use (or are significantly inspired by!) someone else's solution, please make reference to their work. These two solutions do not have to use the same programming language.
